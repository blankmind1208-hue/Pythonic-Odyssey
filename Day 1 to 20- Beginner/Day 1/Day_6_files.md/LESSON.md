**What the elif is this?**

The elif command (which stands for 'elseif') allows you to ask 2, 3, 4 or 142 questions using the same input! This command must be in a certain place. You can have as many elif statements as you want, but they must go in between if and else and have the same indentation. The print statements in your elif command need to line up with the indent of the other print statements.
 
Where would an elif statement go in the code below?
print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
if username == "mark":
print("Welcome Mark!")
else:
print("Go away!")

Answer
An elif statement would go in between the if and else statements.

👉 Add this elif statement to the code above. Make sure you indent properly AND put it in between the if and else statements!

elif username == "suzanne":
 print("Hey there Suzanne!")
 
Your code should look like this:
Answer
print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
if username == "mark":
  print("Welcome Mark!")
elif username == "suzanne":
  print("Hey there Suzanne!")
else:
  print("Go away!")

**Add a password**

Let's add a bit more input.

👉 Now that we have input for both a username and password, we need to change our if and elif statements just a bit so both the username and password must match for Mark and Suzanne to login.

print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
password = input("Password> ")
 
👉 In the code below the username and password must both be correct for Mark to login.
print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
password = input("Password> ")
if username == "mark" and password == "password":
print("Welcome Mark!")
elif username == "suzanne":
print("Hey there Suzanne!")
else:
print("Go away!")
 
👉 Suzanne's password is 'Su74nne'. Can you add that to the code above? (HINT: It should be very similar to Mark.)

**Common Errors**

First, delete any other code in your main.py file. Copy each code snippet below into main.py by clicking the copy icon in the top right of each code box. Then, hit run and see what errors occur. Fix the errors and press run again until you are error free. 

**Syntax Error**

👉 What is wrong the code below?

print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
if username == "mark":

print("Welcome Mark!")
else:
print("Go away!")
elif username == "suzanne":
print("Hey there Suzanne!")

  The elif statement is in the wrong place. It must go in between the if and else statements.
